Result Analysis:

The  GAN models performed well with time series and even stock data for Apple and Amazon, with RSME scores of 5.01 and 3.48 respectively (as shown in Figure 2 and 5). This model did not work for "less popular" stock tickers as the number of tweets about such stocks got drastically lower for companies like Microsoft, Google, and Meta (as shown in Figure 1, 3, and 4.) 

Moreover, using raw historical data gives quite poor predictions, but when technical indicators and Twitter sentiment analysis are added it becomes much easier for the model to make predictions.
